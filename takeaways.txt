SQL function just added another layer of unnecessary step and has about the same amt of info.
EASley: 
-845 logs in the most, 
    - justin is #2
There are spikes in quiz days
There are valleys on holidays and natural disasters
Sa/Sun are the lowest log in days followed by Wed (overall as well)

Staff cohort has the most logins ;)
Everglades only logged in on Wed
Denali: Sun
Apollo:Th
Franklin: nover logged in on Mon
Badlands: never logged in on Sat
Ike: never logged in on Sun

```cats = [ 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

df['weekday'] = pd.Categorical(df.weekday, categories=cats, ordered=True)```
 Life saver for getting barcharts in "order"
